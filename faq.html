<p>Welcome to <u><em><strong>Join Me In Sports!</u></em></strong></p>

<p>The only place on the web where you can find other people to play sports with!</p>

<p>The concept is real simple.  You show the world what sports you like to do, your approx location by zipcode, and how to contact you.
Then anyone who is interested in the same sport can see where you are and contact you.</p>

<p>For example, say you really like to play tennis.  You just moved, are new to the area, and want to meet other tennis players.  You login and go to the tennis activity.  You see a map centered on your location and markers showing all the other tennis players around you.  Click on someone, look at their profile, and contact them if you wish.  Simple as that!</p>

<p>Are you retired?  Are all your friends retired too?  You may have noticed that being retired is not all that fun after all.
The problem is, with so few of your close friends being retired too, you end up doing alot of things by yourself!
That's fun for about once and then it gets tiresome, boring, costly, and not to mention <u>dangerous</u>!  Dirtbike riding by yourself is not smart, for example.</p>

<p>So that's what <u><em><strong>Join Me In Sports</strong></em></u> is all about!  Finding someone close by who shares your sporting interests!</p>

<p>Once you have created your login profile, you may login and search for other people in over 185 sports listed.  Choose someone to contact and go play sports with them!  Simple as that!</p>

<p>Only provide contact information that you want to give out to the world.  At a minimum, we need your email address and first name.  Anything else is optional.  Just follow the instructions...you'll catch on easily!</p>
    
<p>You can also suggest a new sport that we might have missed.  We try to keep up with all sports but new ones are being invented all the time.  Please tell us about them!</p>
